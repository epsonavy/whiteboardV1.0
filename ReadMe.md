Whiteboard V1.0
===============

1. Starting this application will open up one Whiteboard when you execute “Whiteboard.jar”
	-On the Mac OS X operating system, it seems you may only be able to run one instance of one jar file at a time. For your convenience, we’ve added “Another Whiteboard.jar” so you can run that alongside the original Whiteboard to test networking.

2. On the left side of the Whiteboard application are buttons to add / remove / modify shapes in the Canvas and a table with information about the shapes.
	-Some options require a shape to be selected in the Canvas first to be used.
	
3. On the right side of the Whiteboard application is the Canvas. You can select / move / resize shapes by clicking directly on the them.

4. You can use the File menu to open and save XML encoding of objects on the canvas. There is also an option to save as a PNG. You can exit the application from here as well.

5. You can use the Networking menu to host a server or connect to a server. Note that only the server can make final changes of which clients will see.
	-The client can move around his or her objects, however, it doesn't not reflect to the server and the rest of the clients.
	-To exit out of server or client mode, you must exit the Whiteboard application completely.
